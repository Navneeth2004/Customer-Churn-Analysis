# 📊 Banking Customer Churn Analysis – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a Banking Customer Churn dataset to understand the factors influencing customer attrition.  

Customer churn is a critical business problem in the banking industry because retaining customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This analysis aims to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that help banks improve customer retention strategies.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Banks face significant losses when customers discontinue their services.  
The objective of this project is to analyze customer demographic and financial data to identify:

- Why customers leave the bank
- Key factors contributing to churn
- Patterns and relationships affecting customer retention

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Understand dataset structure and variables
- Perform data wrangling and cleaning
- Conduct **Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis**
- Identify trends, correlations, and anomalies
- Generate meaningful business insights
- Provide actionable recommendations

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📂 Dataset Information
The dataset contains customer information from a banking institution.

### Key Features:
- Credit Score
- Geography
- Gender
- Age
- Tenure
- Balance
- Number of Products
- Has Credit Card
- Is Active Member
- Estimated Salary
- Exited (Churn Indicator)

Each row represents a unique bank customer.

## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Dataset Loading
- Imported dataset using Pandas
- Displayed sample records
- Checked dataset size and structure

### 2️⃣ Data Understanding
- Data types inspection
- Statistical summary
- Unique value analysis
- Data dictionary preparation

### 3️⃣ Data Wrangling
- Removed irrelevant columns:
  - `RowNumber`

  - `Surname`
- Renamed columns for clarity
- Created new features:
  - **AgeGroup**
  - **BalanceZero**
  - **TenureGroup**

### 4️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Checked duplicate records
- Handled missing values
- Verified data consistency

### 5️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis
Performed:
- ✅ Univariate Analysis
- ✅ Bivariate Analysis
- ✅ Multivariate Analysis

### Visualizations Used:
- Histogram
- Bar Charts
- Count Plots
- Box Plots
- Scatter Plots
- Violin Plots
- Pair Plot
- Correlation Heatmap

(20+ visualizations with insights)

## 📊 Key Insights
- Older customers show higher churn probability.
- Customers with higher account balances are more likely to churn.
- Geography significantly impacts churn behavior.
- Gender has minimal influence on churn.
- Customer tenure plays an important role in retention.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
The analysis reveals that customer churn is influenced mainly by **age, balance, and geographic location** rather than gender-based factors.  

EDA helps transform raw banking data into actionable business intelligence for improving customer retention strategies.

---

## 💡 Recommendations
- Provide loyalty benefits for long-term customers.
- Introduce personalized offers for older customers.
- Focus retention strategies on high-balance customers.
- Improve services in high-churn regions.
- Monitor early churn indicators proactively.
